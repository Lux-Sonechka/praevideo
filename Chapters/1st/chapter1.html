        <h2>From criptographed diary of Lux</h2>

        "Since I no longer trust my parents, I am now writing my thoughts using adapted greek alphabet.
        Today I broke out of my house, because I couldn't take it anymore... Is it really necessary to listen to all of their unnecessary parent speeches? No, in my option. I did that so.
        Obviously I took some money for drinking a cup of the finest coffee from Caffea's Caf√©. I came inside there, ordered and took a sit. 
        Something different occurred when I was in my way to pay the order, two teenagers named Gabriel and John...
        They accidentaly dropped their coffe on me... That upset me up, however... they paid mine so I suddenly had my sad face turned into a glad expression! I'm befriending them since, we're being great friends...
        I'm really glad that they just accept my pronouns and what I really am... That's surely something to appreciate."

        "I'm so happy being their friends that I just no longer need a diary to write my feelings! I now have them to express my feelings!"

        "Today I met an angel. Not a christian one, or any other time of angel... No, they were even more than just an angel, they were a god!
        They promised I won't suffer anymore like I suffered... I feel it! I feel the power in my veins! Haha... That's great, indeed... Everyone will see what I can do!"
