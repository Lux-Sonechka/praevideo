    <h2>From criptographed diary of Lux</h2>

    "Since I no longer trust my parents, I am now writing my thoughts using adapted greek alphabet but adapted.
    Today I broke out of my house, because I couldn't take it anymore... Is it really necessary to listen to all of they unnecessary parent speeches? No, in my option. I did that so.
    Obviously I took some money for drinking a cup of the finest coffee from Caffea's Caf√©. I came inside there, ordered and took a sit. 
    Something different occurred when I was in my way to pay the order, two teenagers named Gabriel and John...
    They accidentaly dropped their coffe on me... That upset me up, however... they paid mine so I suddenly had my sad face turned into a glad expression! I'm befriending them since, we're being great friends...
    I'm really glad that they just accept my pronouns and what I really am... That's surely something to appreciate."

    "I'm so happy being their friends that I just no longer need a diary to write my feelings! I now have them to express my feelings!"
