        "Today I did something different, I decided to talk to Lux and thank goodness all went well! :D
        During the breakfast in the school's cantine, I've took a sit near Lux, then I noticed that everyone was looking at me, even Lux themself. <br>
        Everyone surely thought Lux would do something bad to me, but actually just began to chat casually
        But there are somethings that gave me goosebumps are that some people asked me how does Lux's voice sound like... Like, they didn't listened to? Anyways I'm so happy to finally talk to my crush! >w< <br>
        The chat was basically like that <br>
        â€” Hey Lux... Why do you always sit alone? <br>
        â€” I like to be alone... <br>
        â€” Okay then, I'm leaving... <br>
        â€” Please, don't... You aren't like the others. Stay with me. <br>
        â€” Okiee then! <br>
        â€” Glad to chat with someone! <br>
        I swear I was so happy about that he smiled! I heard about them, he only talks to teachers, gets only great grades, no one have even seen them smiling before, and stuff"
